Red colored parts are oritinal parts for Ex2p Nikon version.
Most of parts were commercial parts from Thorlab.

[3d-data files (.stl)  are available](https://github.com/rysk-t/ex2p/tree/main/Ex2pO_parts).

## Circuits configuration
Using Analog discovery 2 with custom-made PCB board, TTL for laser modulation were easily configulable.
